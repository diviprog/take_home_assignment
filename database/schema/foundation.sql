-- The shared primitives every object type builds on: the base `object` class

-- Build your ontology below, or in sibling schema/*.sql files that begin with
-- a `-- requires: foundation` header. The vocabulary is yours to design:
--
--   * `create domain` for constrained value types (a rarity, a gold price, a
--     weight) — semantics live in the type, not in prose.
--   * `create type ... as enum` for closed vocabularies.
--   * `create table ... inherits (object)` for each entity type, with
--     `comment on` describing what each table and column means. Those comments
--     are the ontology's self-description — keep them meaningful.
--   * foreign keys for the relationships between entities.
--   * a `touch` trigger per table:
--       create trigger touch before update on <t> for each row
--         execute function touch();
